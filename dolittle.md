Though many of the greatest huntsmen and the cleverest 
menagerie-keepers spent years of their lives searching 
through the jungles in all weathers for pushmi-pullyus, 
not a single one had ever been caught. Only one half of
him slept at a time. The other head was always awake--and
watching. This was why they were never caught 
and never seen in Zoos.
